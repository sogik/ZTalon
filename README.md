# ZTalon

> [!NOTE]
> ZTalon is based on [Talon](https://github.com/ravendevteam/talon) by Raven Development Team, but includes personal modifications and enhancements for improved functionality and user experience.

> [!CAUTION]
> ZTalon is designed to be used on **freshly installed Windows 11 systems**. Trying to use ZTalon on an already in-use system, or a any older versions of Windows, is not guaranteed to work and can cause some apps to stop working properly and system corruption!
